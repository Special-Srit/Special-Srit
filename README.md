# Hi there, I'm Special Srit 👋

## 🚀 My Development Journey

I believe in learning by building. Here's how I've evolved as a developer:

### 📊 Stage 1: Google Sheets
Started with the basics - organizing data, creating formulas, and understanding how information flows. Sometimes the simplest tools teach you the most about structure and logic.

### ⚙️ Stage 2: Apps Script & Google Sheets
Discovered automation and scripting. Learned to make spreadsheets dynamic, automate repetitive tasks, and build custom functions. This was my gateway into actual programming.

### 💻 Stage 3: GitHub API & HTML5 + Bootstrap
Now building real web applications. Integrating APIs, creating responsive interfaces, and version controlling my work. The jump from scripts to full-stack development.
